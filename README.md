# Machine Learning Handbook
Hi, I'm Duong, curently an undergraduate student at MIT. I'm currently pursuing a double major in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making as well as Physics, with minors in Mathematics and Statistics and Data Science. This is my machine learning handbook. Here, I keep Python/Jupyter notebooks of concepts that I learned in class, alongside with my own implementations of them. These implementations might not be the most efficient, but they help me understand the contents much better.

I hope you find them helpful!
